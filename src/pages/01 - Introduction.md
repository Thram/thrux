***Motivation:*** *I've been using Redux in several projects recently and don't get me wrong, I love it, but I've found that at some point, if my app scales, my Redux files (actions/reducers/store) start to get messy and a bit annoying to handle. So inspired by the basic concepts of Redux, I decided to create this library where I've simplified that workflow and aim to have a better and easier file structure.*
